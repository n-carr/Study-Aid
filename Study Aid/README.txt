This application works very similarly to flash cards. You will be presented with a question and, once you have thought of your answer, you must click a button to be presented with the answer. This application will track which questions you answer correctly and incorrectly so that you can re-do the quiz with the questions you answered incorrectly at the end.

I hope this application serves you well.

Please notify me of any bugs you encounter via my GitHub account: https://github.com/n-carr.

HOW TO USE THIS APPLICATION:
----------------------------
Manually enter the questions and answers. 
This process involves typing or copying and pasting the questions into the questions column and the answers into the answers column, then pressing the "Start Quiz" button.
Note that a ^^ in either the question or answer portion will be replaced by a new line during the quiz.

After you start the quiz, you will be given questions and answers one at a time. If you get a question wrong, it will be noted automatically.
At the end of the quiz you will be given the option to run a new quiz. If you choose "Yes," you will see a checkbox that can be selected to be tested on the questions you previously answered incorrectly. You will also have the opportunity to add new questions.
